:summary: Leveraging a well-tried technology for Web, node.jsÂ projects

We have seen a lot of \`\`build tools'' being built in the `node.js`_ world,
`grunt.js`_ and `gulp.js`_ seemingly being the most popular ones. Those provide
an all-in-one solution, supported by a myriad of plugins. They are appealing for
their relative simplicity, and provide a quite decent solution for most
projects.

.. _grunt.js: http://gruntjs.com/
.. _gulp.js: http://gulpjs.com/

There are alternatives, however, and they bring some benefits. First, the
`capability of simple npm scripts`__ is very practical for simple projects.
Second, the :abbr:`UNIX`-ish build system.

The most well-know is probably `GNU Make`_, but `Ninja`_ is another example.
Instead of resting upon plugins, they let the developer use any command-line
statement. As such, they foster a greater reusability: while a command-line tool
can be called without the need of any build system, a grunt.js plugin can only
be used from within the tool.

Why use a build system?
=======================

A build system like ``make`` tracks the state of each file involved, and call
the underlying transformation tools only when necessary. In the following
example, the CoffeeScript_ transpiler_ is called only when ``foo.coffee``
have been modified since the last build:

.. _CoffeeScript: http://coffeescript.org/
.. _transpiler: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler

.. code-block:: make

    foo.js: foo.coffee
        coffee < $< > $@

Here ``$<`` and ``$@`` are `automatic variables`_ providing contextual
file paths. Calling ``make`` from the command line yields:

.. _automatic variables: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/
                         html_node/Automatic-Variables.html

.. code-block:: bash

    make
    #=> coffee < foo.coffee > foo.js
    make
    #=> make: Nothing to be done for `foo.js'.

This is an especially useful behavior on large projects with lots of files
to transpile as it makes development iterations faster.

Where are my tasks?
===================

In addition to file dependencies, ``make`` can handle simple named tasks,
called *phony targets*. For example, a default task could be:

.. code-block:: make

    .PHONY: all
    all: jshint qunit concat uglify

This is the direct equivalent of registering a task as a list in **grunt**:

.. code-block:: js

    grunt.registerTask('all', ['jshint', 'qunit', 'concat', 'uglify']);
